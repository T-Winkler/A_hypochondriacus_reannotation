## TSEBRA

TSEBRA (transcript selector for BRAKER2) is used to generate the final annotation. As input, the full and partial support subsets of the braker2 run with protein and RNAseq input are used,
as well as the Isoseq transcripts predicted by cpc2 as coding and with intact ORF. The long_read.cfg file is used for TSEBRA.
