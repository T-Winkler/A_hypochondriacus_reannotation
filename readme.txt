## A. hypochondriacus reference genome v2.2

Polishing of the previously published A. hypochondriacus reference genome v2.1 to generate the reference genome v2.2. The polished reference genome was annotated combining computational gene prediction with evidence from full-length transcript sequencing data. The two data sources were combined using TSEBRA into the genome annotation v2.2.

Code: 
all code used for genome polishing, repeat masking, computational annotation, long-read RNA sequencing data assembly, merging into the final annotation and identification of flavonoid and betalain pathway genes and MYB transcription factors.
